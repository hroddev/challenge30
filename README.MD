# My first JavaScript Challenge

Hi, my name is Hector and I started to learn to code in JS recently.
I hope someone can help you and any questions you can ask me with confidence.
Any suggestions, I'm happy to receive input.

Thank you for share your knowledge!  [Challenge 30](https://javascript30.com/)
